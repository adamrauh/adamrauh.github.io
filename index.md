title: Hello

My name is Adam Rauh. I am currently working in the [Political Methodology Lab](http://pmlab.mit.edu/) at MIT as a statistical research and computational specialist. Broadly speaking, I am interested in applications of statistics and machine learning in the social sciences and American politics and developing useful statistical software. I also enjoy topics in sports analytics. 

Aside from this, I enjoy discussing, collecting, and using analog tools and writing instruments. I am also a diner and breakfast food enthusiast.
