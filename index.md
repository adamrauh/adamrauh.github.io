My name is Adam Rauh. I am currently a PhD student at the University of Michigan. I am interested in American political institutions, interest group politics, and topics related to money in politics. I also enjoy political methodology, and I am primarily interested in the development and application of computational methods and machine learning in the social sciences. 

I previously worked at the [Political Methodology Lab](http://pmlab.mit.edu/) at MIT, where I contributed to the [LobbyView](https://www.lobbyview.org/) project and helped develop the [PanelMatch](https://github.com/insongkim/PanelMatch) R package.
